Epic-E-Shop is a full-stack e-commerce application that offers real-time inventory and reminder system for Fortnite's item shop. Users can browse every item in Fortnite's history, as well as today's daily items and featured items. The live data is retrieved using FNBR's community-made third-party API.

Not only can users view items, but they can also engage in several ways. They can comment on items, vote on items, and even set reminders for items. When an item returns to the shop, the user is notified by email. There's also an e-commerce aspect to the site; each new user is given 20,000 V-Bucks to start shopping. They can add items to their carts, remove items, and check out. Once purchased, items go to their inventory. Users can also view all items they own, have set reminders for, have voted on, and have commented on in their profile page.

The live site can be found [here](https://epic-e-shop.onrender.com/).
